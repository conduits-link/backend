# Architecture

* Django
    * Easy and fast
    * Python allows for future possibility of easy server-side ML

* MySQL database
    * Store user details, user text files, and links to other user media files
    * SQLite has size restrictions and can't be used with client-server model
    * PostgreSQL seemed like overkill for now
